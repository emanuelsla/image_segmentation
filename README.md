# Image Segmentation

This repository is property of Emanuel Slany. It is created with the purpose of building a image segmentation workflow for autonomous driving.
It will train a model based on existing data sets for autonomus driving. Afterwards, it will be able to perform image segmentation on personal photographies. 

## Contents

### Setup


### Preprocessing
This repository uses the [udacity data set for autonomus driving](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car). 

The first preprocessing step is to rearrange the folder structure as follows:

'''
data_folder
|
|-> image_folder
|    |
|    |-> containing all the images
|
|-> label_folder
    |
    |-> label.csv
'''

These data are saved locally.
